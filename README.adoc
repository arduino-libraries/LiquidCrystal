This library allows an Arduino board to control liquid crystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs.

For using with VFD Futaba M242SD was added command for setting brightness:

Usage:

lcd.bright(LCD_BRIGHT100);   // set brightness to 100%

lcd.bright(LCD_BRIGHT75);    // set brightness to 75%

lcd.bright(LCD_BRIGHT50);    // set brightness to 50%

lcd.bright(LCD_BRIGHT25);    // set brightness to 25%
